# 🚗 Car Price Estimation Using AI 🧠

This project features a powerful AI-driven model designed to accurately estimate car prices based on various attributes like model, year, mileage, and more. Built for a competitive event, this project achieved **first place in accuracy**, proving its reliability and precision in predicting car values.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved first place in a competitive event for accuracy in price predictions.
- **Comprehensive Feature Set**: Takes into account key attributes such as model, year, mileage, condition, and location.
- **AI-Powered with Random Forest**: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for reliable and fast predictions.
- **Easy Integration**: Ideal for use in car marketplaces, dealerships, and individual valuation tools.

## 🔧 How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Aggregates data on car specifications, including make, model, year, and mileage.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleans and processes data, transforming it into features that enhance model performance.
3. **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest model for price prediction.
4. **Prediction**: Based on input parameters, the model outputs an estimated price, providing a reliable valuation.

## 📊 Example Usage
```python
from model import CarPricePredictor

# Sample input
car_data = {
    "model": "Toyota Camry",
    "year": 2018,
    "mileage": 30000,
    "condition": "Good",
    "location": "California"
}

# Predict price
price = CarPricePredictor.predict(car_data)
print(f"Estimated Price: ${price}")
## 📈 Model Performance
- **Event Outcome**: First place in accuracy
- **Validation Metrics**: Demonstrates high precision and low error rate, ideal for real-world applications

## 🤖 Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest algorithm (Scikit-Learn)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Other**: Matplotlib for visualizing results (if relevant)

## 💡 Future Improvements
